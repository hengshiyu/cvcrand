# cvcrand 0.1.0

## Major changes

1. revised the `cvrall()` function to deal with the case that less than or equal to one scheme meets the constraints of the constrained space. 

2, revised the description files of the `cvrall()`, `cvrcov()`, `cptest()` functions and datasets. 

3, revised the vignettes file to better describe the examples.
